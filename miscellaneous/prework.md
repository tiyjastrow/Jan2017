### Introduction

This prework should be completed before class starts. You can do it over a weekend, or you can spread it out over a longer period of time if you prefer. Please don't rush yourself. Its purpose is to arm you with basic knowledge that you can hopefully gain independently of classroom instruction. The last section mentions a few things I'd like you to email me.

### Computer Setup

For the purposes of this prework, all you need is a browser; we generally use [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). For our class, we'll be using [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for development. We'll be installing these things the day before class during the install party, but it's fine if you've already done so.

### Java

Java will be the main language we work with during the class. Please work through at least the 1st two parts of [KTByte Interactive Textbook in Java](https://www.ktbyte.com/java-tutorial/book). Then work through the [Codecademy course on Java](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-java). Don't worry if you don't grasp the concepts at first. Just try to get familiar with the language keywords and programming constructs in general. This will make learning much easier for you the 1st week of class.

### Unix & Mac

Get familiar with the Mac Operating System if you are not already. Start with [Mac Basics](https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/) to learn about the Mac interface. And [An intro to the OS X command line](http://eddywashere.com/blog/an-intro-to-the-os-x-command-line/) for the work we will do in the Terminal. *Note: use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) instead of the mentioned `sublime` editor for command line text editing; or use vim which I highly recommend although it does take a bit more time to learn. ([practive vim here](http://www.openvim.com/))

### HTML & CSS

While not a focus of the course, we will need to do some front-end development when we get into web applications. Work through the [Codecademy course on HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) so you have a basic familiarity with them.

### Git

Working with Git will be a HUGE part of this class. Familiarity with it is going to be an essential requirement almost everywhere you work. Its purpose is to store "snapshots" (called commits) of your code, so you can see your progress and revert your changes if necessary. It also makes it easy to push your changes to a server, which acts as a backup of your code as well as an easy way to collaborate with other programmers.

Watch this [Github Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE). Then;
1. Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account, as it is the most popular Git host and the one we'll be using throughout the class. Make sure to add a profile picture and your name.
2. Send me your username. 
3. Then, work through [Try Github](https://try.github.io/), a short course on how to use Git.

### Scala

We'll be learning some Scala later in the course to familiarize ourselves with the new industry trend towards functional programming. Please skim thru Lightbend's [Scala Overview](http://www.lightbend.com/community/core-projects/scala#overview). After that watch [Martin Odersky's talk on Scala](https://youtu.be/3jg1AheF4n0)

### Typing practice

Typing is incredibly vital to this course. You will be spending 8-12 hours a day on your computer coding, researching, and using the web. Now is the time to learn to type correctly if you don't already know how!

Practice up on [keybr.com](http://keybr.com), this will ramp up the difficulty and make you more comfortable typing properly.

Your hands should rest on what is called the "Home Row" so that your index (pointer) fingers land on the little dots on the F and J keys while your thumbs both sit on the edges of the space bar. Focus on proper technique first and work through a few of the exercises working on the keys E, A, I, and N.

Start by working on [keybr.com](http://keybr.com) for about 30mins and then continue to the next sections of the prework. You will want start every day briefly (10-15 mins/day) on keybr.com during the prework period. Also, when working on class assignments and daily computer use, use these typing techniques so that typing becomes 2nd nature!

### Deliverables

Please email john.jastrow@theironyard.com your Github username. Please take the opportunity to also tell me about any difficulties you think you'll encounter during the course.

### Misc

For further reading and exercises totally worth your while before class starts, during, and after:

#### Algorithms 
Algorithms are to programming as a recipe is to cooking. An algorithm is generally a way or certain steps to follow to solve a certain problem.
